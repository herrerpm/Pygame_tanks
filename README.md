# Pygame tanks

This project is a pygame version of the popular game
pocket tanks. It will have variable terrain, and two tanks.
One will be controlled by the player, and the other by the
computer.

The tanks will be able to move a number of times to left or right,
and aim using 180 degrees. The bullets will have gravity and the
main objective of the game is to be the first tank to reach 5 hits 
on it's enemy.
